# ISS Tracker App
ISS Real Time Tracker

## About This Project
This is a simple JavaScript project involving technology like Fetch API to grab ISS real time location data and presented it in map using LeafletJS and OpenStreetMap. 

## Technology Used
For this project i'm using html5, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling, and vanilla JavaScript to Fetch data from [WhereTheIssAt](https://wheretheiss.at) and manipulate the DOM to display the data, i'm also using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com) a JavaScript library to displaying interactive maps. Map tiles is retrieved from [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) 

## Challege
Even though the app look simple there's so much things going on behind the app, but using the JavaScript library such as LeafletJS makes the building process more fast and easy. In the next version I will add ISS orbit line to make it more informative.
